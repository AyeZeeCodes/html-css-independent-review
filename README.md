##Check out my recent Epicodus projects

Here are a few of my favorite repos that I have created while at Epicouds. I also included a little information about myself so you can get to know me a little better. Contact me if you have any questions.

###Project setup

There is nothing to set up to view this project. Because it was built with HTML and CSS it can be viewed on my github pages link [here](http://ayezeecodes.github.io/html-css-independent-review/).
